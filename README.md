# Credit Card Transaction & Customer Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of credit card transactions and customer behavior using Power BI.  
The objective of the dashboard is to identify key revenue drivers, spending patterns, customer demographics, and card usage trends to support data-driven decision-making.

This project is created as a portfolio project to demonstrate skills in data analysis, visualization, and business insight generation.

## SQL Usage
SQL Server was used as the primary data source for this project.  
Data was imported directly from relational tables into Power BI.

Most data transformations, aggregations, and analytical calculations were performed within Power BI using Power Query and DAX, which is a common industry practice for business intelligence reporting.
